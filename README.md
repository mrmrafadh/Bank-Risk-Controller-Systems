Bank-Risk-Controller-Systems Project
Project Overview: The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts if a customer will default on a loan. We'll use historical loan data to build and test this model, and then make it available through a Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

Skills and Technologies:

Python: For data preprocessing, machine learning, and deploying the model.

Analytics & Statistics: For exploring the data and creating useful features.

Plotting Tools: Using Plotly and Seaborn to create visualizations.

Machine Learning Models: Includes KNN Classifier, Random Forest, and XGB Classifier.

Deep Learning: Using advanced techniques if necessary.

Streamlit: For creating interactive dashboards and deploying the model.

Problem Statement: We aim to predict if a customer will default on a loan based on historical data, focusing on the TARGET column.

Business Use Cases:

Risk Management: Assess borrower risk to help with loan approval.

Customer Segmentation: Create tailored financial products based on risk.

Credit Scoring: Improve traditional credit scoring methods.

Fraud Detection: Identify patterns that indicate fraudulent applications.

Approach:

Data Collection:

Gather historical loan data from the provided dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers, and encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand data distributions and relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering:

Create features that make the model more accurate.

Model Selection:

Test various models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Training:

Train the chosen model(s) using the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Check the model's performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize the model parameters to improve performance.

Model Deployment:

Use Streamlit to deploy the model for real-time predictions.

Expected Outcomes:

Streamlit Dashboard:

Data Tab: Display the dataset and model performance metrics.

EDA - Visual Tab: Show EDA analysis and plots using Plotly or Seaborn.

Prediction Tab: Input feature values to predict loan default status.

Project Evaluation Metrics:

Aim for metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC to be above 87%.

Data:

Dataset: Historical loan application data, including personal details and loan status.

Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize or standardize numerical variables.

Engineer features based on domain knowledge.
